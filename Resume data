Project
Water Potability Detection: MLOPS and CI/CD
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cnoZm1GkztMcnmQ2WjtaQMtvZVMBbnpo?usp=sharing 
	Collected and processed raw data using web scraping techniques; structured data into clean CSV format with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs) for parsing and transformation.
	Performed hyperparameter tuning, model training, and versioning using MLflow, with proper model registry, tracking, and monitoring integrated into the pipeline.
	Developed and tested RESTful APIs using FastAPI for serving machine learning models and ensuring robust backend integration.
	Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) workflows using GitHub Actions for automating code testing and deployment.
	Conducted experiment tracking and version control through DagsHub for collaborative ML development.
	Built and compared multiple ML model versions, evaluating performance through accuracy, F1-score, and other key metrics.


Advance RAG 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/199rmgvYn6VDyycDeIL_QnxZ5JEwHd8Ki?usp=sharing 
•	Implementing Hybrid RAG Search (using keyword search + Chroma DB retrieval + vector search) using LangChain and HuggingFace transformer and also having memory.
•	Implementing Reranking (rank_bm25, cross encoder and cohere).
•	Implement Lost in middle phenomena and overcoming using merger and compression retriever.
•	Implement RAG Fusion to combining results from multiple query variations.
•	Flash Reranking as it ensures the most useful ones guide the generation.
•	Implementing Context Compression Retriever, Self Retriever, Parent-child Retrieval, Sentence Window Retriever and HyDE Retriever.
Kidney tumor detection and MLOPS
https://github.com/PiyushVIT346/kidney-tumor-classification-mlops 
•	Developed a VGG16 based deep learning model (~94% accuracy) for CT based kidney tumor detection.
•	Designed and implemented a full MLOps pipeline using DVC (data/model versioning), MLflow/DagsHub (experiments), and GitHub Actions (CI/CD), ensuring end-to-end reproducibility.
•	Containerized the model and deployed it via a Flask API, enabling scalable inference in production-like environments.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HgC4aK16dUtKjlNqlo3c3U4bvXzW4QYl?usp=sharing 
•	Trained a deep learning model to classify medical documents and scans, accurately identifying whether an image was an X-ray, CT scan, or Brain MRI using image classification techniques.
•	Enhanced model performance by applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with ResNet-50, improving accuracy on complex medical image datasets.
•	Developed a chatbot for disease detection that interacts with users through symptom-based input, identifies potential illnesses using NLP, and provides basic first-aid suggestions and care tips.
•	Built a personalized food timetable generator that considers the user's health history (e.g., past diseases), age, dietary preferences (veg/non-veg), and chronic conditions to generate nutritionally appropriate meal plans.
